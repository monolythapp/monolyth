# Week 5 Summary — New UI + Mono + Nav

**Date**: End of Week 5  
**Focus**: UI shell migration, Mono integration, ActivityLog expansion, core golden path completion

---

## What we implemented

### New Bolt-Inspired UI Shell
- **Sidebar**: Fixed left navigation with active route highlighting using `usePathname()`
- **TopBar**: Search, theme toggle, user menu, Mono toggle button
- **Mono Pane**: Slide-in assistant panel (400px width) accessible on all core pages
- **Layout consistency**: All pages use `p-8 max-w-[1600px] mx-auto space-y-8` pattern
- **Dark/light theme**: Custom theme provider (replaced `next-themes` for React 19 compatibility)

### Routes Implemented
- ✅ **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`): Overview with summary cards, recent activity
- ✅ **Workbench** (`/workbench`): Unified table, Analyze, Save to Vault
- ✅ **Builder** (`/builder`): Template selection, document generation, Save to Vault
- ✅ **Vault** (`/vault`): Document table, version counts, search/filter
- ✅ **Playbooks** (`/playbooks`): UI shell with typed mock data, empty state
- ✅ **Share** (`/share`): UI shell with typed mock data, empty state
- ✅ **Activity** (`/activity`): Real ActivityLog data, filters, clickable links
- ✅ **Settings** (`/settings`): Settings UI with Billing sub-page

### Save to Vault — End-to-End
- **Workbench mode**: Saves existing unified items to Vault
- **Builder mode**: Creates new unified_item + document rows
- **Backend**: `/api/documents/versions` route with proper auth, FK handling, error logging
- **Frontend**: Both Workbench and Builder handlers with proper error surfacing
- **Result**: Documents appear in `/vault` immediately after save

### ActivityLog Expansion
- **New event types**:
  - `analyze_completed` (from Workbench Analyze)
  - `doc_generated` (from Builder)
  - `doc_saved_to_vault` (from Save to Vault)
  - `mono_query` (from Mono pane)
- **Centralized helpers**: `lib/activity-log.ts` with `logActivity`, `logAnalyzeCompleted`, `logDocGenerated`, `logDocSavedToVault`, `logMonoQuery`
- **Activity page**: Real Supabase queries, type/date filters, summary cards, clickable document links

### Activity Page Features
- Fetches real data from `activity_log` table
- Filters by event type (all, analyze_completed, doc_generated, doc_saved_to_vault)
- Filters by date range (24h, 7d, 30d)
- Summary cards: Today's Activity, Active Users, Documents Touched
- Clickable links to `/vault?documentId=...` or `/workbench?unifiedItemId=...`
- Empty state with helpful message
- Loading and error states

### Playbooks & Share — Typed Mock Data
- **Playbooks**: 
  - Typed view models (`PlaybookSummary`, `PlaybookStatus`)
  - 4 mock playbooks with different statuses
  - Empty state with CTAs
  - Table view with actions
- **Share**:
  - Typed view models (`ShareLinkSummary`, `SharePermission`, `ShareProtection`, `ShareStats`)
  - 4 mock share links with different permissions/protections
  - Empty state with CTA
  - Table view with stats

### Mono Pane Integration
- **Component**: `components/mono/mono-pane.tsx` with `MonoContext` type
- **Backend**: `/api/mono` route with:
  - Authentication via `getRouteAuthContext`
  - ActivityLog integration (`mono_query` events)
  - Stubbed responses (ready for OpenAI integration)
- **Mounting**: All core pages pass context to `MonoAssistant` via `AppShell`
- **Context awareness**: Route, selectedDocumentId, selectedUnifiedItemId, filters

### UX Polish
- Empty states for Playbooks, Share, Activity
- Table text truncation for long titles
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Improved loading/error states on Activity page
- Filter spacing improvements

## Known gaps / bugs

### Save-to-Vault Owner/Org Mapping
- **Issue**: Assumptions about `owner_id`/`org_id` mapping that may need hardening for multi-org scenarios
- **Impact**: Low (works for single-org use cases)
- **Fix needed**: More robust org/owner resolution logic

### Mono Replies Still Stubbed
- **Issue**: `/api/mono` returns placeholder responses, not yet "smart" across all flows
- **Impact**: Medium (Mono pane is accessible but not yet useful)
- **Fix needed**: Integrate OpenAI client (same pattern as Analyze)

### Playbooks/Share Not Backed by Supabase
- **Issue**: Using typed mock data, not real database queries
- **Impact**: Low (UI is ready, data layer pending)
- **Fix needed**: Create Supabase tables and queries (Week 7–9)

### Error States Could Be More Robust
- **Issue**: Some error handling could provide better user feedback
- **Impact**: Low (core flows work, edge cases may be unclear)
- **Fix needed**: Enhanced error messages and recovery paths

### No Onboarding Experience
- **Issue**: First-time users see empty states but no guided setup
- **Impact**: Medium (may confuse new users)
- **Fix needed**: First-run wizard or guided tour

## Pushed to Week 6+

### Beta Hardening
- **More robust error states**: Better error messages, recovery paths, retry logic
- **Feature flags**: For risky paths (e.g., experimental Mono features)
- **Onboarding docs**: User guides, API docs, troubleshooting
- **First 3–5 real beta users**: Real-world testing and feedback

### Future Features
- **Real Playbooks engine**: Triggers, conditions, actions, scheduling
- **Real Share link management**: Creation, revoke, passcode/watermark enforcement
- **Guest Spaces**: External guest accounts, Smart Share Page
- **External connector hardening**: Google Drive read/write, Gmail, other integrations
- **Signatures integration**: Documenso webhook handling, envelope management
- **Insights dashboards**: Time saved metrics, bottlenecks, risky docs/workflows
- **Advanced Mono features**: Real OpenAI integration, cross-page context, workflow suggestions

---

## Technical Debt

- **Theme provider**: Custom implementation (replaced `next-themes` for React 19), could be simplified
- **ActivityLog helpers**: Centralized but could add more type safety
- **Route auth**: `getRouteAuthContext` works but could be more robust for edge cases
- **Mock data**: Playbooks/Share use in-file mocks, should move to shared constants or fixtures

---

## Next Steps (Week 6)

1. **Beta readiness**: Harden error states, add feature flags, prepare onboarding
2. **Mono AI integration**: Connect `/api/mono` to OpenAI (same pattern as Analyze)
3. **Signatures**: Complete Documenso integration
4. **Beta user onboarding**: First 3–5 users, gather feedback
5. **Documentation**: User guides, API docs, troubleshooting
