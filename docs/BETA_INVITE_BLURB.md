# Monolyth Beta – Invite Blurb

Below is a short blurb you can reuse in emails, DMs, or posts when inviting people into the Monolyth Beta.

Hi [Name],

I'm running a private Beta for **Monolyth**, a document-first workspace that connects all your docs and gives you one AI operator to work across them.

For this Beta, the goal is to test a simple "golden path":

1. Analyze a document in **Workbench**.

2. Use **Builder** to generate a Version 1 draft and make a few edits.

3. **Save to Vault** so it becomes a tracked asset.

4. Check **Activity** to see what happened.

5. Ask **Mono** some questions about the document.

The build is stable but not final. Some features are intentionally hidden behind feature flags, and Mono currently returns a stub response rather than full AI-powered answers. That's by design for this phase – I'm focused on validating the workflow, UI clarity, and where people get stuck or confused.

If you're up for kicking the tires and giving honest feedback, I'll set you up with access and a short checklist. It should only take 15–20 minutes to run through the flow once.

Thanks,  
[Your Name]
