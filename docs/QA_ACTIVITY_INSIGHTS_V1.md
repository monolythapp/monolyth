## 1. Testing /activity page

### 1.1 Basic page load

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/activity

2. **Expected:**
   - Page title: "Activity"
   - Subtitle: "A single place to answer 'what just happened?' across docs, Mono, connectors, and signatures."
   - "View insights" link in header
   - Filter section with:
     - Time range buttons (Last 24 hours, Last 7 days, Last 30 days)
     - Event group chips (Docs, Mono, Connectors, Signatures, System)
     - Search input
   - Activity table with columns: When, Event, Source, Context
   - Events display in reverse chronological order (newest first)

### 1.2 Time range filters

1. Click "Last 24 hours" → verify only events from last 24h show

   - Provider filter appears below (All, Drive, Gmail)

4. Click "Signatures" chip → verify only `signature_*` events show

5. Click "System" chip → verify only `system_*` and `playbook_*` events show
