## ⏳ Not in Beta Yet (Explicitly Out of Scope)

- Prebuilt recipes for NDAs/proposals
- Playbook execution and scheduling
- **Status**: UI shell exists, engine implementation pending

### Share Link Management
- Real share link creation/revoke
- Passcode generation and validation
- Watermark application
- Expiry enforcement
- **Status**: UI shell exists, backend implementation pending

### Guest Spaces
- External guest accounts
- Smart Share Page (aggregated view for guests)
- Guest permissions and access control
- **Status**: Not started

### External Connectors
- Google Drive full integration (read/write)
- Gmail integration
- Other connectors (Notion, etc.)
- **Status**: Base wiring exists for Drive, needs hardening

### Signatures
- Documenso integration
- Envelope creation and management
- Webhook handling for status updates
- **Status**: UI shell exists, integration pending

### Insights Dashboards
- Time saved metrics
- Bottleneck identification
- Risky docs/workflows detection
- **Status**: Not started

### Advanced Mono Features
- Real OpenAI integration (currently stubbed)
- Cross-page context awareness
- Autonomous workflow suggestions
- **Status**: Stub + logging exists, AI integration pending

## Beta Readiness Checklist

- ✅ Core golden path works: Workbench → Analyze → Builder → Save to Vault
- ✅ ActivityLog tracks key events
- ✅ Mono pane accessible on all pages
- ⏳ Share link creation/management (UI ready, backend pending)
- ⏳ Signatures integration (UI ready, Documenso pending)
- ⏳ Playbooks engine (UI ready, engine pending)
- ❌ Guest Spaces
- ❌ Insights dashboards
- ❌ Advanced connectors

## Known Limitations

1. **Save-to-Vault owner/org mapping**: Assumptions about owner_id/org_id that may need hardening for multi-org scenarios.
2. **Mono replies**: Mostly stubbed responses, not yet "smart" across all flows.
3. **Playbooks/Share data**: Using typed mock data, not yet backed by Supabase.
4. **Error states**: Some error handling could be more robust.
5. **Onboarding**: No first-run experience or guided setup yet.

## Week 6 Additions (Beta Hardening)

The following items were added or hardened during Week 6:

- **Golden path stability:** Dashboard → Workbench → Builder → Vault → Activity → Mono flow runs end-to-end with no known P0 issues.

- **Error handling:** All golden-path screens use consistent toast-based error handling for API failures and auth errors.

- **RLS & auth review:** Row-Level Security policies for `unified_item`, `document`, and `activity_log` were reviewed and documented for the Beta phase.

- **Feature flags:** Half-built surfaces (Playbooks engine, advanced share actions, extra connector filters, Vault experimental actions) are gated behind feature flags and hidden or marked "coming soon" for Beta users.

- **Telemetry & diagnostics:** Minimal server-side telemetry plus `/api/health` and `/dev/health` for internal diagnostics.

- **Onboarding & first-run UX:** Dashboard welcome card, nav explanations, and a Workbench "Demo NDA (sample only)" empty state were added to guide new users.
