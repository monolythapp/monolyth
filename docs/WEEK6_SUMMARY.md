# Week 6 Summary – Monolyth Beta

This document summarizes what changed in Week 6, the current stability of the Beta build, known limitations, and the focus for Week 7.

---

## What Changed in Week 6

- **Golden path hardened**

  - Dashboard → Workbench → Builder → Vault → Activity → Mono flow tested and stabilized.

  - Mono now responds with a stubbed reply without auth errors or raw error messages.



- **Error handling & auth**

  - Centralized client-side error handling via a shared helper.

  - All golden-path pages (Workbench, Builder, Vault, Activity, Mono) show clear toasts for API failures and auth issues.

  - Auth failures render a consistent "Session expired" pattern instead of raw errors.



- **RLS & security review**

  - RLS policies for `unified_item`, `document`, and `activity_log` reviewed and documented in `W6_RLS_REVIEW.md`.

  - Confirmed that the single-user dev setup behaves as expected and there are no obvious cross-user leaks for Beta.



- **Feature flags & risk containment**

  - Introduced feature flags for:

    - Playbooks engine

    - Advanced Share actions

    - Extra Workbench connector filters

    - Vault experimental actions (Open in Builder, 3-dot menu)

  - Beta defaults leave half-built surfaces hidden or clearly labeled as "coming soon".



- **Telemetry & diagnostics**

  - Added `lib/telemetry-server.ts` for structured server-side logging.

  - Instrumented key API routes (analyze, generate, save to Vault, mono chat) with telemetry events.

  - Implemented `/api/health` and `/dev/health` for internal diagnostics, including feature flag states.



- **Onboarding & first-run UX**

  - Dashboard now shows a "Welcome to Monolyth Beta" card explaining the golden path.

  - Dashboard includes a short explanation of what each main nav section does.

  - Workbench shows intro copy plus a "Demo NDA (sample only)" empty state when the user has no Vault documents.

## Current Stability (End of Week 6)

- **Golden path:** No known P0 issues; the workflow runs end-to-end with Mono stub behavior.

- **Error handling:** All major flows surface errors via toasts; no silent failures expected on main routes.

- **Activity logging:** ActivityLog entries are generated for key actions with useful metadata and no crashes on Activity page.

- **Security:** RLS and auth patterns are consistent with the Beta's single-tenant assumptions.



---

## Known Limitations (Acceptable for Beta)

- Mono currently returns a **stub response**, not full AI-powered answers.

- Playbooks engine and advanced Share workflows are **intentionally disabled** via feature flags.

- Extra connector filters and Vault experimental actions are hidden or marked "coming soon".

- Some UI/UX polish and edge cases remain at **P1/P2** level; they are documented in `W6_ISSUES.md`.



These limitations are acceptable for inviting a small initial set of Beta users.

## Week 7 Focus (Playbooks Engine v1)

Planned focus for Week 7:



- Implement the first usable version of the **Playbooks engine**, starting with a narrow set of automation templates.

- Wire Playbooks into ActivityLog and telemetry so runs can be monitored and debugged.

- Tighten any Beta feedback from the first 3–5 users, especially around:

  - Where the golden path feels confusing.

  - Where the app needs more guidance or inline help.

  - Any newly discovered P0/P1 issues.



---

## Code Freeze Note

As of the end of Week 6, the Beta build is effectively under a **soft code freeze**:



- No new features should be added before the first Beta users are invited.

- Only emergency bug fixes (especially any new P0 issues) should be merged.
